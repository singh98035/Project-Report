# Project-Report
  Firstly our Goal of this project find the attainment of each course's outcomes and then the attainment of final course, which we calculate the attainment by the individual student
  Achieve the goal of project we all mates work on some modules.
 1. Installation  of  moodle.
 
      Firstly we study about moodle installation process on windows from internet follow the documentation of moodle [https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Windows_installation](https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Windows_installation)   download the moodle package from [https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/](https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/) then install the localhost server like xampp from that link [https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
      After that we all face  many problems and error like Execution time 60sec it takes too many times and waste 2 or 3 days.
After facing the problems than  we all exploring the internet as told by our mentor the we find the bitnaami and find the exe file of moodle that easy to install in our machine download it from [https://bitnami.com/stack/moodle/installer](https://bitnami.com/stack/moodle/installer).
After that our mentor gave the command to study the database of moodle
Yesterday
 we all study the database schema of moodle from documentation[https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Database_schema_introduction](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Database_schema_introduction)
 After that we study the moodle database contain 200 tables.The big problem is this we don't have to understand it all at once.the good thing is that only that tables to understand useful for project and forgot all. after that i study the constraints two table like "assign" is used for assignment module the "assign" table is join with others tables. 2nd table is "course" .After our mentor provide the some Documents to understand the course outcomes, program outcomes and attainment. 
 
 at least one query occurs in mind you can say question.
 
we all don't study the all tables. the query is that what table is important for project?how many tables we will study?
